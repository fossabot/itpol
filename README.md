# Useful IT Policies
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FHartmarken%2Fitpol.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FHartmarken%2Fitpol?ref=badge_shield)


In this repository we provide generalized IT policies adapted from those used
internally by our IT staff in hopes that they will come in handy for other
organizations, and especially for open-source projects who rely on volunteer
admin efforts to manage their infrastructure.

We invite all others to participate, share and donate back their knowledge and
expertise to help create a library of checklists and best practice documents
that can be freely used and adapted by others.
